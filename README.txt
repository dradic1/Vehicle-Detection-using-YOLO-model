# Vehicle Detection Using the YOLO Model  

This repository contains a project developed as part of the **Digital Image and Video Processing** course at the *Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology Osijek (FERIT)*.  

The goal of the project was to implement a system for **vehicle detection and counting** using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model**.  

---

## Project Description  
The system is designed to:  
- Detect vehicles moving in **two opposite directions**.  
- Count the number of vehicles passing in each direction.  
- Record the total number of vehicles that have passed in both directions.  

By utilizing YOLOâ€™s real-time object detection capabilities, the project demonstrates how deep learning models can be applied to video-based traffic analysis.

## Technologies Used  
- **YOLO model** for object detection  
- **Python** (main programming language)  
- **OpenCV** for image and video processing  
- Supporting libraries for data handling and visualization  

---

## Purpose  
This project was developed as a **faculty assignment** with the aim of combining theoretical knowledge of digital image and video processing with practical application of computer vision and deep learning techniques.
